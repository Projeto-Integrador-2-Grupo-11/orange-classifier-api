Detect freshness of fruits

To get the best predictions use the test images from the kaggle dataset. In case you want to test it on other images then make sure you tick these all conditions:-
- The image is .jpeg or .png.
- The image is of a Apple, Banana or Orange.
- The image has a white background.

These many constraints are because of the limited training data and the model is as good as the data on which it is trained.
